# Kong Configuration Approaches: Declarative vs Database-backed

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between Kong's two primary configuration approaches: **Declarative (DB-less)** and **Database-backed** configurations.

## 📋 Overview

| Aspect | Declarative (DB-less) | Database-backed |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Configuration Source** | YAML/JSON files | PostgreSQL database |
| **Runtime Changes** | ❌ Requires restart | ✅ Dynamic via Admin API |
| **Database Required** | ❌ None | ✅ PostgreSQL |
| **Startup Time** | ⚡ Fast | 🐌 Slower (DB + migrations) |
| **Route Availability** | 🚀 **Immediate** | ⏳ After API configuration |

## 🔧 Configuration Methods

### 📄 Declarative Approach
```yaml
# config/kong.yaml
_format_version: "3.0"
services:
  - name: httpbin-service
    url: http://httpbin:80
    routes:
      - name: httpbin-route
        paths: ["/httpbin"]
        strip_path: true
```

**Setup Command:**
```bash
./setup-kong-httpbin-declarative.sh
```

### 🗄️ Database-backed Approach
```bash
# Create service via Admin API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/ \
  --data "name=httpbin-service" \
  --data "url=http://httpbin:80"

# Create route via Admin API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/httpbin-service/routes \
  --data "paths[]=/httpbin" \
  --data "strip_path=true"
```

**Setup Command:**
```bash
./setup-and-test-kong-httpbin.sh
```

## ⚡ Startup & Performance

### 🚀 Declarative (DB-less)
**Startup Sequence:**
1. Start backend services (HTTPBin, Express.js)
2. Start Kong with config file
3. **Routes immediately available** ✨

**Startup Time:** ~10-15 seconds

**Performance Benefits:**
- ✅ No database queries during runtime
- ✅ Lower memory footprint
- ✅ Faster request processing
- ✅ No database connection overhead

### 🗄️ Database-backed
**Startup Sequence:**
1. Start PostgreSQL database
2. Run Kong migrations
3. Start Kong
4. Configure services via Admin API
5. Configure routes via Admin API
6. Routes become available

**Startup Time:** ~45-60 seconds

**Performance Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Database queries for configuration
- ⚠️ Higher memory usage
- ⚠️ Database connection pool overhead
- ⚠️ Potential database bottlenecks

## 🔄 Migration Strategies

### 📄 From Database to Declarative
```bash
# Export existing configuration
kong config db_export kong.yaml

# Switch to declarative mode
# Update docker-compose to use config file
# Remove database dependency
```

### 🗄️ From Declarative to Database
```bash
# Import declarative config to database
kong config db_import kong.yaml

# Switch to database mode
# Add PostgreSQL service
# Update Kong configuration
```
